            <h1>Asset Management Control</h1>
            <h4 class="underline"> March, 2017 - April</h4>
            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> This project is based on vehicle(assets) auctions. Broadly, in this digital world, they
                    would like to document everything from seller raising a hand to sell that and buyer wants to buy that asset. It has
                    onsite auctions and online auctions as well in different locations across the world. I, majorly, worked on
                    Asset management control.</li>
                <li> In this, asset life cycle plays a vital role. It will be started from creating
                    opportunity for the seller and it goes different phases such as moving that asset to contract ready, pre
                    selling phases which involves inspection, adding asset details, photos to the project and eventually it
                    dissolves with selling to another customer.</li>
                <li>Apart from asset management control which I worked on
                    mostly, there are another multiple projects like sale admin(which is about selling assets with stipulated
                    things which will be managed by admin), site admin..etc.</li>
                <li>
                   It uses different technologies ranging from spring boot to angular(12+)
                    to SQL. UI design look good with angular material modules everywhere which is the standard one for the
                    total project. Service layer designed with java and spring boot. 
                <li>In different application in this project we have much of
                        repeated code so, they used different npm libraries. We need to write most of the code in libraries form and
                        publish them into real code so that they can use for another projects too.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Responsbilities </h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Delivering work on time and not going beyond deadlines is my first
                    priority as a developer.</li>
                <li> Review and
                    analyze tickets which are assigned to me and get clarification on those tickets from the client as  
                    early as I can.</li>
                <li> Giving demo of the features to clients and setup for sign off meetings
                    with business analysts so that feature goes smooth. I would like to write code to get a less code
                    review comments from the client side.</li>
                <li>
                    I am also started to take care of Production incidents. I am managing doing prod
                    incidents along with my regular feature tickets. I believe production incidents/issues make us
                    learn more because we would be more exposed the whole code of the project.</li>
