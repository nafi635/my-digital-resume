            <h2>Responsbilities </h2>
            <ul>
                <li> I got into completely new end to end project where I was the only
                    one working for UI development. </li>
                <li> Business gives UI representation or Sketch through Figma
                    application frames. It was quite
                    daunting task as they were demanding exact inch-to-inch design with even width and height of
                    the elements should be same.</li>
                <li> API implmentation - I had to implement multipl API's based on the requirement and calling them through the Graph QL.</li>
                <li> Along with them, I need to connect to UI from open search(Elastic search) data base and
need to write Graph QL queries for getting a data.</li>
            </ul>
